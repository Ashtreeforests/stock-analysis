# stock-analysis
Project Overview

The Purpose

The goal of this project was to refractor the VBA code in Excel with the qualified data points of stock from the years 2017 and 2018. The purpose of this evaluation was to analyze the value of stocks to be invested. The refractor method for this VBA code was intended to heighten efficiency over the origianl (non-refractored) cocde.

The Data

The attached files include screenshots of the two charts generated as a result of the code. One for the year 2017 and another for the year 2018. The source stock data includes ticker value, stock issued date, opening/closing and adjusted closing price, highest and lowest price, and stock volume. Our goal was to compile the ticker value, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.

Project Results

The Analysis

The refactored code was modified from the original code to provide a more accurate and efficiency analysis. Our code started with creating a ticker index and defining the output arrays. This is followed by establishing loops  and the if/then statements to run through all the desired data points for the outcome. 

Here is the execution time and output from the refactored 2017 code:

Summary

Refactoring Code

The main advantage to refactoring code is that it increases maintability. Refactored code means you are working with a cleaner code that is easier to read and/or interpret. Refactoring code, or making the code easier to read, also means the code-writing is a longer process. The main disadvantage to refactoring code is that it is more time consuming. The worst case scenario for refactoring code is reaching an unknown point with no clear idea of how to move forward. 

Pros and Cons

For this project, the biggest advantage to refactoring the code was it decreased the macro run time. There were a few stumbling blocks to overcome in the coding to make the refactored code work to the benefit of the project. The time taken to refactor this code may reduce the time required to refactor a similar code for a different project. The end result of a refactored code is it's a cleaner and easier read.
